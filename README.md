Quora Question Pair Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of Quora question pairs to determine whether a pair of questions are semantically similar. The primary objective is to explore the patterns and trends in the question pairs and to develop a model that accurately identifies similar questions. This analysis helps in enhancing the user experience on Quora by reducing redundant questions and improving the efficiency of information retrieval.

## Description

The project utilizes a dataset of question pairs from Quora, where each pair is labeled as either duplicate or non-duplicate. The analysis focuses on understanding the characteristics of similar questions and applying machine learning techniques to build a predictive model. Key aspects include text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data to identify trends and patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features from text data.
- **Model Building:** Training machine learning models to predict question similarity.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using various metrics.
- **Visualization:** Interactive dashboards to visualize findings and model performance.

## Steps for Approach

1. **Data Collection:** Obtain the Quora question pair dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the text data (e.g., removing stop words, stemming).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualize the distribution of question pairs, word clouds, and correlation between features.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Create features such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, and sentence similarities.
5. **Model Building:** Train various models like logistic regression, random forest, and deep learning models.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate models.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model parameters for better performance.
8. **Visualization:** Develop interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau or Plotly.

## KPIs

- **Accuracy:** Proportion of correctly identified question pairs.
- **Precision:** Proportion of predicted duplicates that are actually duplicates.
- **Recall:** Proportion of actual duplicates that are correctly identified.
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **AUC-ROC:** Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

## Implementation

### 1. Install Required Libraries
Ensure necessary Python libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow are installed.
